    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Brendan
    \n\nI like baseball and video games.
    \nI\'ve played baseball for the last 11 years, and played on the Thornhill Reds rep team for about 7.
    \nRecently I stepped down, however, because I wanted to focus on school.
    \n\nAs for video games, I like to play lots of different types of games.
    \nI play Counter Strike and League of Legends at a decent level, but also enjoy
    \nsingleplayer RPGs. My favourite is The Witcher 3, which I believe is one of the best games ever made.
    \n\nI study Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo. It\'s the study of the
        development and fabrication on materials on the nanometer scale.
